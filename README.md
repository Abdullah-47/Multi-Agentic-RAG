# ü§ñ Advanced Agentic RAG System

A powerful, multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Streamlit, LangChain, and Groq LLMs. This project demonstrates a modular, self-correcting workflow for answering user queries using both internal knowledge sources and real-time web search, with built-in fact-checking and safety mechanisms.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Workflow:** Modular agents for routing, retrieval, query reformulation, web search, synthesis, answer generation, fact-checking, and safety checking.
- **Hybrid Knowledge Sources:** Supports both uploaded files (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and URLs as knowledge bases, with fallback to default sources.
- **Dynamic Query Handling:** Automatically routes queries to the best agent (internal retrieval, web search, clarification, etc.) based on context.
- **Self-Correction:** Reformulates queries and retries retrieval before falling back to web search.
- **Fact-Checking:** Extracts factual claims from generated answers and verifies them using real-time web search.
- **Safety Checking:** Analyzes generated content for harmful or inappropriate material and revises or blocks unsafe responses.
- **Interactive UI:** Streamlit-based chat interface with workflow visualization, logs, and configuration sidebar.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Easily adjust chunk size, retriever top-K, and LLM temperature from the sidebar.

**Agent Roles:**
- **Router:** Decides the best workflow path for each query.
- **Retriever:** Fetches relevant documents from the internal knowledge base.
- **Reformulator:** Improves queries for better retrieval.
- **WebSearcher:** Finds real-time, external information.
- **Synthesizer:** Combines information from various sources.
- **Generator:** Creates the final answer.
- **FactChecker:** Verifies factual claims in the generated answer.
- **SafetyChecker:** Ensures generated content is safe and appropriate.
- **Clarifier:** Asks user for more details if needed.

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** This project requires Python 3.9+.

### 4. **Set Up API Keys**

Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the project root with the following content:

```toml
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = "your_langchain_api_key"
TAVILY_API_KEY = "your_tavily_api_key"
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_google_api_key"
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key"
```

- Get your API keys from:
  - [LangChain](https://smith.langchain.com/)
  - [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com/)
  - [Google Generative AI](https://ai.google.dev/)
  - [Groq](https://console.groq.com/)

### 5. **Run the Application**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üí° Usage

1. **Configure Knowledge Sources:**  
   - Add URLs (one per line) and/or upload files (TXT, PDF, DOCX) in the sidebar.
   - Adjust chunk size, retriever K, and LLM temperature as needed.
   - Click "Apply Parameters & Update Knowledge" to refresh the knowledge base.

2. **Chat:**  
   - Enter your question in the chat input.
   - The system will process your query through the multi-agent workflow and display the answer.
   - View workflow logs, knowledge sources, and a diagram of the agent flow in the "Execution Details" section.

3. **Reset:**  
   - Use "Clear Chat History" to reset the conversation and logs.
